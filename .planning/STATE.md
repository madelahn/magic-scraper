## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v1.1:

- Schema: Normalized `Game` + `GameParticipant` tables with free-text playerName; no separate Player table
- Rate limiting: In-memory Map accepted for private ~10-user app (no Upstash Redis)
- Charts: Recharts with `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` — never import in Server Component
- Schema apply: `prisma db push` (dev) + manual `turso db shell` (prod) — `prisma migrate deploy` incompatible with Turso
- Alerting: Discord webhook via fetch (zero dependencies); no email/Resend needed

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 (401 Games): Cloudflare challenge type unknown — JS challenge may be bypassable via ScraperAPI `render=true`; IP-based block is not. Test with standalone script before planning Phase 9.
- `prisma migrate deploy` incompatible with Turso — manual schema application required for production
