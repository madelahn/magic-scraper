# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Friends can instantly see who in the group owns any card from a decklist, and check which local stores have it in stock.
**Current focus:** Phase 06.1 — game-differentiation-and-sanitization

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v1.1:

- Schema: Normalized `Game` + `GameParticipant` tables with free-text playerName; no separate Player table
- Rate limiting: In-memory Map accepted for private ~10-user app (no Upstash Redis)
- Charts: Recharts with `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` — never import in Server Component
- Schema apply: `prisma db push` (dev) + manual `turso db shell` (prod) — `prisma migrate deploy` incompatible with Turso
- Alerting: Discord webhook via fetch (zero dependencies); no email/Resend needed
- [Phase 07]: Game interface isImported field made required boolean (not optional) since Prisma defaults to false
- [Phase 07]: Stats page shell uses focus refetch for STAT-07 reactive updates, 9 memoized stat computations, mobile collapse/expand with Set state

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 (401 Games): Cloudflare challenge type unknown — JS challenge may be bypassable via ScraperAPI `render=true`; IP-based block is not. Test with standalone script before planning Phase 9.
- `prisma migrate deploy` incompatible with Turso — manual schema application required for production

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 06.1 inserted after Phase 6: Game differentiation and sanitization (URGENT) — ~20 spreadsheet-ported games need exclusion from combo/deck stats; GameForm needs duplicate-player guard; games list needs winner/player-count/player filters
