# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Friends can instantly see who in the group owns any card from a decklist, and check which local stores have it in stock.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Serverless Browser Migration

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Serverless Browser Migration) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase (02-01 done, 02-02 next)
Status: Phase 2 plan 1 complete — puppeteer replaced with chromium-min + fetch
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Phase 2 plan 1 complete (puppeteer → chromium-min + fetch migration)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 37%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~15 min
- Total execution time: ~0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-database-migration | 2 | ~30min | ~15min |
| 02-serverless-browser-migration | 1 (of 2) | ~7min | ~7min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~28min), 01-02 (~2min), 02-01 (~7min)
- Trend: Fast execution

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Shared password (not individual accounts) — small closed group, no per-user identity needed
- Turso for DB — SQLite-compatible, minimal Prisma changes, generous free tier
- @sparticuz/chromium for Puppeteer — keeps existing scraper logic, works in Vercel serverless
- Vercel Cron for nightly sync — free tier supports daily cron, no external service needed
- Session/cookie for auth — simple stateless auth with httpOnly cookie, no auth library overhead
- [01-02] scrapeMoxfield call stays before $transaction — network I/O must not hold a DB transaction open
- [01-02] Error thrown (not swallowed) from transaction catch block — API route returns non-200 to admin
- [01-01] Migration applied via Node.js script (not turso CLI) — Turso CLI has no Windows build
- [02-01] chromium-min upgraded to 143.0.4 + puppeteer-core@24.39.1 — 133.0.4 no longer published; 143 is stable latest with confirmed pairing
- [02-01] Tarball URL uses architecture-specific x64 pack — v143 GitHub releases split by arch; Vercel is x64 Linux
- [02-01] defaultViewport removed from launchBrowser() — not exported by chromium-min v143 types
- [Phase 02-02]: Caching partial results (products + failedStores) together so one flaky store does not invalidate the cache entry
- [Phase 02-02]: maxDuration = 60 exported on scrapeLGS route — explicit Vercel function budget for browser scraping
- [Phase 03-01]: Admin password checked first in login route so admin users get both session and admin_session cookies
- [Phase 03-01]: Login route returns JSON redirect field (not NextResponse.redirect) — client fetch must not follow server-side 307 redirect
- [Phase 03-01]: .gitignore /auth pattern scoped to project root to avoid blocking src/app/api/auth/
- [Phase 03-00]: jest.config.js used (not .ts) — ts-node not installed, .js avoids the peer dependency
- [Phase 03-00]: setupFiles runs jest.setup.ts before each test file so env vars are available at module load time
- [Phase 03-02]: ConditionalHeader uses usePathname('/login') check — avoids per-page layout logic, single wrapper in root layout
- [Phase 03-02]: Logout is a button (not Link) because it fires a POST fetch before navigating — semantic correctness
- [Phase 03-02]: Admin page no longer holds password state — proxy cookie (admin_session) is the sole auth gate

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: chromium-min@143.0.4 + puppeteer-core@24.39.1 installed — version pairing verified via sparticuz devDependencies (RESOLVED for 02-01)
- Phase 2: 401 Games scraper cannot be validated without a live Vercel deployment — deferred to v2 if Cloudflare blocks Vercel IPs
- Phase 1: `prisma migrate deploy` does not work against Turso — use `prisma migrate diff --script` + `turso db shell` instead
- Phase 4: Verify Vercel fluid compute is enabled in project settings before relying on 300-second function budget
